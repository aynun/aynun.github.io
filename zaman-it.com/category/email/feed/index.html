There is a premium service which costs money, and a standard service which is free. We will use the standard edition. Sign up!</p>
<p>Google Apps Sign-up :</p>
<p>Select the option for &#8220;Administrator: I own or control this domain&#8221;.</p>
<p>Enter the domain name which will have email hosted by Google.</p>
<p>Click the Get Started button.</p>
<p>Fill in the required fields and place a check next to &#8220;I understand that if I cannot alter DNS records for my domain, I may impact my organization&#8217;s ability to use Google Apps&#8221;.</p>
<p>Click the Continue button.</p>
<p>Google Apps Create Administrator Account</p>
<p>Type a username and a password. Be sure to re-enter the password.</p>
<p>Read the Terms and Conditions for using the Google Apps service. When you are ready, click &#8220;I accept. Continue with set up Â»&#8221;.</p>
<p>This completes the registration. You are now logged in to your Google Apps Dashboard (control panel).</p>
<p>Verify your account:</p>
<p>Once you create an account for your domain name, you must verify that you own the domain name.</p>
<p>At the top of your Dashboard you will see, &#8220;To activate Google Apps services you must verify that you own your domain &#8211; yourdomain.com&#8221;. Next to this, click the link calledVerify domain ownership.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can verify that you own the domain:</p>
<p>1. (Recommended) You can upload an HTML file to your website.<br />
Create and upload a file named googlehostedservice.html to http://yourdomain.com/ . If this is your primary domain, the correct folder is public_html.<br />
Edit the file and paste the given code into it.<br />
googleffffffffc4ffb5fe<br />
Please note &#8220;googleffffffffc4ffb5fe&#8221; is an example, and you should instead use the code provided to you by Google.<br />
Save the changes, and make sure you can see the file at http://yourdomain.com/googlehostedservice.html.<br />
Go back to the Google Apps page and click the Verify button.</p>
<p>2. You can create a CNAME record to point to google.com .<br />
Login to WHM and click DNS Functions &gt; Edit DNS Zone.<br />
Create a new CNAME record for your domain:<br />
googleffffffffc4ffb5fe 14400 IN CNAME google.com.<br />
Please note &#8220;googleffffffffc4ffb5fe&#8221; is an example, and you should instead use the code provided to you by Google.<br />
If you do NOT have access to edit your DNS zones, or do not feel comfortable making the changes, please contact eicra.com for assistance.<br />
Go back to the Google Apps page and click the Verify button.</p>
<p>After you click the Verify button, allow up to 48 hours for Google to verify your are the owner of the domain name.</p>
<p>Start using Google Email</p>
<p>At the Google Apps Dashboard, click the Email link. You can change any of these settings as you see fit.</p>
<p>Click the link for Email activation Instructions on how to activate Email.</p>
<p>Read the instructions carefully. If your domain already has email addresses, you should create user accounts before changing your MX records.<br />
1. Create user accounts</p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Create user accounts&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Enter a first and last name for the email user. Enter the name of his email address.</p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Create new user&#8221; button.</p>
<p>If you need to enter more emails, click the &#8220;Create another user&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Once finished, go back to the Dashboard tab at the top. To quickly get to the next step, click the Activate email link, located directly under the Email link.</p>
<p>2. Set up email delivery</p>
<p>If you skipped creating email users, then click the &#8220;Change MX records&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Google reminds you to create the email users before you change the MX records, or you may have email downtime.</p>
<p>Google also offers you temporary email addresses, so you can use Google mail before the MX record change. The format is similar to name@yourdomain.com.test-google-a.com (The temporary email address will be deactivated once you change the MX records.)</p>
<p>You see &#8220;Showing instructions for&#8221; and a drop down box. Select &#8220;cPanel&#8221; as your hosting company. Follow the instructions, but there is an extra step you might need.</p>
<p>Note: The steps are for the cPanel X theme; however, most eicra.com clients are using the X3 theme. Here are the instructions for X3:<br />
Log in to your cPanel account.<br />
Click the MX Entry icon.<br />
Under Change MX Entry, in the drop-down box, select the domain name you are changing.<br />
Leave the priority as 0.<br />
Paste the Google MX record in the last field. Be sure to remove the ending dot, so that cPanel will accept it. EXAMPLE:<br />
Change MX for [yourdomain.com] Priority: [0] to: [ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM]<br />
Do NOT check the box for &#8220;Always accept mail locally&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
Click the Change button.</p>
<p>Extra step?</p>
<p>If you have a MX record which resolves locally, you will need to contact us via phone, live chat, or email support@eicra.com and make the request. (If you have never before changed your MX record at EICRA.COM, then you likely need this extra step.)</p>
<p>If you already have an MX entry resolving to a remote server, you can skip the extra step.</p>
<p>All done?</p>
<p>Be sure to go back to the Google Apps page and click the &#8220;I have completed these steps&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Accessing Webmail</p>
<p>Go back to the Google Apps Dashboard and click the Email link.</p>
<p>Next to Web address you see a sign-in address (URL) which is similar to http://mail.google.com/a/yourdomain.com .</p>
<p>The login is the email name WITHOUT @yourdomain.com and the temporary password given by Google. You can find the temporary password by going to the &#8220;Users and Groups&#8221; tab at the top. Click the email account in question, and the password will be revealed.</p>
