				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2099 alignright" src="http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/logo-300x67.png" alt="logo" width="300" height="67" srcset="http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/logo-300x67.png 300w, http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/logo.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This is best answered by the examples below&#8230;</p>
<p>For example, a customer signs up with us and has attacks up to 40k PPS or so. Very small, right? Likely, the customer is being attacked by an attacker which is running DDoS attacks as a business. As a business, that attacker is only using the resources required to impact you. Once protection brings the site up, the attacks normally increase. Sometimes the increase is only a few thousand PPS but we it could increase exponentially by manipulating the attack pattern or simply throwing more resources at you.<br />
Second Example:</p>
<p>1) We hear horror stories of customers going to provider &#8216;x&#8217; and the attack is being reported, for example, at 2Gbps.</p>
<p>2) That person changes providers because they don&#8217;t want to pay the upgrade, they are unhappy, etc.</p>
<p>3) They are setup with the new provider and now the impact is gone! *poof*</p>
<p>4) Customer raves how wonderful the new provider is and the provider states they are filtering the attack. (Yet they may only be seeing 5% of what was the overall prior)</p>
<p>5) All is well&#8230;. Month passes&#8230;. Now this provider is reporting 2Gbps and the their site is down because they purchased 1Gbps of protection. This worked last month! Why does it not work now!?</p>
<p>We have done trials for customers and continued to receive their attack for weeks after their domain was moved from our IP. I&#8217;m sure they found another provider who was cheaper and *appeared* to be doing everything they stated and we were simply trying to pull the covers over their eyes.<br />
There are far too many variables in the mitigation market to simply provide a guaranteed outcome if the customer isn&#8217;t willing to:</p>
<p>1) Stick it out and let the mitigation do it&#8217;s job.For example:&#8211; A burst hits and the customer begins thinking the mitigation isn&#8217;t working! Yet, they are seeing less than 1% of what the burst is, however to them it&#8217;s the end of the world. The company isn&#8217;t doing their job so they change DNS instead of allowing a few minutes for things to settle and detection to accurately block the fresh attack or pattern change.</p>
<p>&#8212; The DNS change severely disrupts traffic flow and attack output or input to the mitigation provider. This, in turn, lowers the overall attack incoming but makes it unstable and now the profile for the attack has changed by 50% or more. Therefore, original thresholds in place to prevent the attack are no longer low enough to be hit because the attack just dropped 50% below the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8212; This requires the provider to either manually lower those thresholds to compensate for the drop or wait on the mitigation to do this automatically. Changes in this form, manual intervention, can cause severe disruptions in the efficiency of mitigation overall.</p>
<p>Now, DNS is just one factor and I used it as an example because it is the most typical. However, you have to trust the provider and believe in what they&#8217;re doing. If you cannot trust your provider and cannot allow them time to do their job then the purpose of mitigation is wasted. Any change or modification, caching, database changes, site layout, etc. Some of the simplest modifications can greatly increase efficiency or greatly reduce overall efficiency.</p>

There is a premium service which costs money, and a standard service which is free. We will use the standard edition. Sign up!</p>
<p>Google Apps Sign-up :</p>
<p>Select the option for &#8220;Administrator: I own or control this domain&#8221;.</p>
<p>Enter the domain name which will have email hosted by Google.</p>
<p>Click the Get Started button.</p>
<p>Fill in the required fields and place a check next to &#8220;I understand that if I cannot alter DNS records for my domain, I may impact my organization&#8217;s ability to use Google Apps&#8221;.</p>
<p>Click the Continue button.</p>
<p>Google Apps Create Administrator Account</p>
<p>Type a username and a password. Be sure to re-enter the password.</p>
<p>Read the Terms and Conditions for using the Google Apps service. When you are ready, click &#8220;I accept. Continue with set up »&#8221;.</p>
<p>This completes the registration. You are now logged in to your Google Apps Dashboard (control panel).</p>
<p>Verify your account:</p>
<p>Once you create an account for your domain name, you must verify that you own the domain name.</p>
<p>At the top of your Dashboard you will see, &#8220;To activate Google Apps services you must verify that you own your domain &#8211; yourdomain.com&#8221;. Next to this, click the link calledVerify domain ownership.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can verify that you own the domain:</p>
<p>1. (Recommended) You can upload an HTML file to your website.<br />
Create and upload a file named googlehostedservice.html to http://yourdomain.com/ . If this is your primary domain, the correct folder is public_html.<br />
Edit the file and paste the given code into it.<br />
googleffffffffc4ffb5fe<br />
Please note &#8220;googleffffffffc4ffb5fe&#8221; is an example, and you should instead use the code provided to you by Google.<br />
Save the changes, and make sure you can see the file at http://yourdomain.com/googlehostedservice.html.<br />
Go back to the Google Apps page and click the Verify button.</p>
<p>2. You can create a CNAME record to point to google.com .<br />
Login to WHM and click DNS Functions &gt; Edit DNS Zone.<br />
Create a new CNAME record for your domain:<br />
googleffffffffc4ffb5fe 14400 IN CNAME google.com.<br />
Please note &#8220;googleffffffffc4ffb5fe&#8221; is an example, and you should instead use the code provided to you by Google.<br />
If you do NOT have access to edit your DNS zones, or do not feel comfortable making the changes, please contact eicra.com for assistance.<br />
Go back to the Google Apps page and click the Verify button.</p>
<p>After you click the Verify button, allow up to 48 hours for Google to verify your are the owner of the domain name.</p>
<p>Start using Google Email</p>
<p>At the Google Apps Dashboard, click the Email link. You can change any of these settings as you see fit.</p>
<p>Click the link for Email activation Instructions on how to activate Email.</p>
<p>Read the instructions carefully. If your domain already has email addresses, you should create user accounts before changing your MX records.<br />
1. Create user accounts</p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Create user accounts&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Enter a first and last name for the email user. Enter the name of his email address.</p>
<p>Click the &#8220;Create new user&#8221; button.</p>
<p>If you need to enter more emails, click the &#8220;Create another user&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Once finished, go back to the Dashboard tab at the top. To quickly get to the next step, click the Activate email link, located directly under the Email link.</p>
<p>2. Set up email delivery</p>
<p>If you skipped creating email users, then click the &#8220;Change MX records&#8221; link.</p>
<p>Google reminds you to create the email users before you change the MX records, or you may have email downtime.</p>
<p>Google also offers you temporary email addresses, so you can use Google mail before the MX record change. The format is similar to name@yourdomain.com.test-google-a.com (The temporary email address will be deactivated once you change the MX records.)</p>
<p>You see &#8220;Showing instructions for&#8221; and a drop down box. Select &#8220;cPanel&#8221; as your hosting company. Follow the instructions, but there is an extra step you might need.</p>
<p>Note: The steps are for the cPanel X theme; however, most eicra.com clients are using the X3 theme. Here are the instructions for X3:<br />
Log in to your cPanel account.<br />
Click the MX Entry icon.<br />
Under Change MX Entry, in the drop-down box, select the domain name you are changing.<br />
Leave the priority as 0.<br />
Paste the Google MX record in the last field. Be sure to remove the ending dot, so that cPanel will accept it. EXAMPLE:<br />
Change MX for [yourdomain.com] Priority: [0] to: [ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM]<br />
Do NOT check the box for &#8220;Always accept mail locally&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
Click the Change button.</p>
<p>Extra step?</p>
<p>If you have a MX record which resolves locally, you will need to contact us via phone, live chat, or email support@eicra.com and make the request. (If you have never before changed your MX record at EICRA.COM, then you likely need this extra step.)</p>
<p>If you already have an MX entry resolving to a remote server, you can skip the extra step.</p>
<p>All done?</p>
<p>Be sure to go back to the Google Apps page and click the &#8220;I have completed these steps&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Accessing Webmail</p>
<p>Go back to the Google Apps Dashboard and click the Email link.</p>
<p>Next to Web address you see a sign-in address (URL) which is similar to http://mail.google.com/a/yourdomain.com .</p>
<p>The login is the email name WITHOUT @yourdomain.com and the temporary password given by Google. You can find the temporary password by going to the &#8220;Users and Groups&#8221; tab at the top. Click the email account in question, and the password will be revealed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1527 alignright" src="http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11-300x140.png" alt="11" width="300" height="140" srcset="http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11-300x140.png 300w, http://zaman-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The users of Zaman-IT.com frequently ask how to reduce your WordPress CPU load without upgrading your web hosting server? The last thing you’ll ever want is a slow server which might affect your Google ranking, a constant server crash (if you’re on dedicated server) or your web hosting company shutting off your blog without warning due to excessive usage. Here are the 7 method I used to reduce my WordPress CPU load and bandwidth without upgrading to a much more expensive server.</p>
<p>CPU Usage- What is it?<br />
The usage that a system’s central processing unit incurs is referred to as CPU usage. A shared server is actually a dedicated or virtual machine, which is divided on the basis of bandwidth and disk space. When this shared server exceeds the CPU usage parameter, the web host will suspend that account temporarily. Hence, if you have a wordpress blog, ensure keeping CPU usage to its minimum.</p>
<p>How to lower CPU Usage?<br />
CPU usage usually depends on the amount of request that your server receives. Besides, it may also depend on the number of people accessing your site/blog at the same time. Whatever the reason may be; your objective is to reduce CPU usage.</p>
<p>Step 1. Remove Unnecessary Plugins</p>
<p>This might be first point you would ever see in WordPress CPU optimization. Plugins are the most resource eating materials when it comes to WordPress. Hosting companies usually suggest maximum 3 or 4 plugins but in the live case, it isn’t possible unless we run a story narration blog.</p>
<p>Since we are solely depending on plugins to automate certain processes, it’s really hard to find the plugins which should be avoided.</p>
<p>In this scenario, we must compromise on visual effects and should focus on blog optimisation. ie., concentrate on necessary show ups and avoid eye-catching sliders, related posts plugins etc.</p>
<p>In order to find the most resource consuming plugin, you can try P3 Profiler (Which is again a plugin :P). It accurately measures your server resource from head to toe from plugins side and show the results in in the form of easily understandable charts.</p>
<p>Try to avoid use of badly coded related post plugins. Related post plugins have many issues. Even good plugins in this category like ‘Yet Another Related Posts Plugin (YARPP)’ has many issues.</p>
<p>Many web hosts have banned its use in shared hosting plans. It resulted in high load of CPU and increased query time. Think before using them. I suggest you to use nRelate Related Posts plugin instead of YARPP.</p>
<p>Step 2. Minimize the number of WP Crons:</p>
<p>The WordPress Cron job is a resource intensive task that runs every single time yourWordPress is accessed.The best way to optimize the efficiency of your WordPress cron jobs is to disable WP-cron and set up a normal cron job through cPanel which will run every 12 hour or once per day.</p>
<p>You can disable WP-cron by modifying the wp-config.php (located in the folder where WordPress is installed). Open the wp-config.php file, add a new line after <!--?php, then add the following code on the new line:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 3. Using Cache Plugins&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W3 Total cache (W3TC) and WP Super Cache are the most effective cache plugins I’ve ever came across. Though some people suggest WPSC, I should recommend you to install W3TC as it’s loaded with advanced options like minification, database cache, page cache, cache purging, CDN optimization, CloudFlare integration etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After installing either of these plugin (Preferably, W3TC), configure every options from its dashboard. It can also be used to flush your temporary DNS cache which is very helpful wherein DNS propagation period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 4. Using CloudFlare&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CloudFlare is a free blog optimization service which can also be considered as a basic CDN service. Don’t expect too much from their CDN as it accelerates your blog without any bucks. However, you can significantly improve your page loading speed and CPU load.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It works as an intermediate between the blog and the server. Whenever user requests a page, CloudFlare provides the page without letting the blog from accessing the server contact. It automatically catches your pages from the server side and stores in its own large data servers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s see an example. Suppose you are going to get some milk from a cow (Physically). How it would be if you get the milk from a milkmaid which has already been taken from the cow? Isn’t it easy? It literally reduces the load of “cow” (Server here) from frequent disturbance. It also provides faster access and you don’t have to walk longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the same manner, CloudFlare grabs your pages from the server and stores in a place (Data centers) where it can be accessed quickly without pinging to the server. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 5. By Compressing/Merging Existing Images in your Posts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a saying ” A picture can speak thousand words”. When it comes to blogging, images are most important factor to grab attention of the readers. On the other hand, it can also be used to gain entry search engine traffic by correctly rendering Alt tags.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But excessive insertion will not only slower your blog but also turns as a nuisance to your loyal readers. Whatever it may be, you may reduce maximum picture additions in your blog. Alternatively, you can host your all images in a sub domain which won’t affect your page speed, hence faster response from server.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the hosting companies provide image optimization tools in cPanel. You can either depend any of these free tools or use any 3rd party apps. Also if you are posting long articles which possesses dozens of images, you can split the post to 2 or 3 pages with respect to the length of the article. This method can also be used in comment section if you are getting hundreds of comments in each posts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 6.Optimize your CSS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By removing unnecessary codes and line breaks, you might have the opportunity to reduce the CSS file size by 50%. Again, this translates into massive bandwidth saving due to the fact that your style.css file is downloaded every time a unique visitor visits your blog. Here is one of my favorite online tool – Online CSS Optimizer or Clean CSS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 7. Enable the Default WordPress Object Cache&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WordPress 3.0 and higher comes with a feature known as WordPress Object Cache, sadly it is not enabled by default, therefore making this feature somewhat of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Step 1 – Open your wp-config.php file&lt;br ?--> Step 2 – Insert the following code</p>
<p>1<br />
define(&#8216;ENABLE_CACHE&#8217;, TRUE);<br />
Step 3 – Create the cache directory</p>
<p>1<br />
/wp-content/cache/<br />
Step 4 – Change the ‘cache’ folder writable permission to 755 or 777<br />
To set it’s expiration time you can add this line:</p>
<p>1<br />
define(‘CACHE_EXPIRATION_TIME’, 900);<br />
If you’re using Wp-SuperCache of W3 Total Cache, ignore the WordPress Object Cache feature. Last but not least, use a good WordPress theme, choose wisely, a well coded theme will greatly reduce the number of queries, have minimal W3C error and is Google friendly. Insert this quote to find out the number of queries for different themes:</p>
<p>1<br />
&lt;?php echo $wpdb-&gt;num_queries; ?&gt;q, &lt;?php timer_stop(1); ?&gt;s</p>
<p>Step 8. Update Possible Functions.</p>
<p>Many plugins release newer versions in certain interval of time. Some themes also update as well. Here, if you don’t update these functions properly, it will automatically surpass update requests whenever you load your blog. So update every plugins and themes (including WordPress) as fast as possible.</p>
<p>In short, Always update everything. If there is an update available, you should always go for it. Updates contain security improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The bottom line</p>
<p>With every passing day, the technology world is introducing new advancement. And with new advancements, your chances of getting new ideas to lower CPU usage increases too. So, keep yourself updated with the advancements and pave your way to a smoothing performing blog with high traffic surges.</p>
